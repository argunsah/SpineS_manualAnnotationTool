Manual Dendritic Feature and Tracing Tool

For Tracing:

Pick a couple point on the dendritic branch of interest using left mouse click. (More points longer waiting time)
Right click after the last point chosen.

If tracing looks nice, click Yes. If not Click No to re-do. Done will complete tracing.

Press z to zoom during tracing. x to un-zoom. d deletes the last point.

(So you need: z,x,d,right mouse click, left mouse click)

For Feature Annotation:

First Chose what you want to annotate in the list.
Click the center of the desired features. (Center of Spine Head, Center of Dendrite, Center of spine neck, as shown in supplementary figure of the paper)

Program will save files at the end. You share manually annotated files, we add them in the training list to create a better Dendritic Feature Detector.
